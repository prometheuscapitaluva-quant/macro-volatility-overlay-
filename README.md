# üìä Macro Volatility Overlay Strategies

This repository contains research code and notes for developing **macro derivative strategies**, focusing on volatility structures in commodity and index futures.

We use option pricing models such as **Black 76** (for futures options) to build systematic overlays that hedge risk, monetize volatility, or express macro views.

---

## üöÄ Overview

- **Strategies:** Macro volatility overlays (commodities, indices, FX).  
- **Instruments:** Options on futures (e.g., Coffee, S&P 500 futures, EUR/USD).  
- **Execution Context:** Designed for delayed broker fills (40 min ‚Äì 2 hours).  
- **Focus:** Simple, interpretable models with real-world execution constraints.

---

## üìê Intuition Behind Black 76

The **Black 76 model** is a variant of Black-Scholes, designed for **options on futures or forwards** rather than spot assets.  

### Why Not Black-Scholes?  
- In macro trading, we often deal with **futures contracts** (e.g., Coffee, FX, equity index futures).  
- Futures already incorporate carry (interest rates, dividends, storage costs), so there is **no need for discounting** as in Black-Scholes.  
- Black 76 directly uses the **forward/futures price \( f \)** instead of spot \( S \).  

---

### The Core Idea  
Option pricing boils down to **two ingredients**:  
1. **Where the forward is relative to the strike** (\( f \) vs \( k \)).  
2. **How much uncertainty there is until expiry** (volatility \( \sigma \), time \( t \)).  

The model encodes this through two terms, \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \):  

![d1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d_1%20=%20\frac{\ln\left(\tfrac{f}{k}\right)%20+%20\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}})  

![d2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d_2%20=%20d_1%20-%20\sigma\sqrt{t})  

- **\( d_1 \)**: Measures how many standard deviations the forward price is above the strike, adjusted for volatility and time.  
- **\( d_2 \)**: Shifts \( d_1 \) downward by one ‚Äúvolatility step‚Äù, capturing the probability of expiring in-the-money.  

---

### Option Pricing Formulas  

- **Call Option** (right to buy futures at strike \( k \)):  

![call](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?C%20=%20f%20\cdot%20N(d_1)%20-%20k%20\cdot%20N(d_2))  

- **Put Option** (right to sell futures at strike \( k \)):  

![put](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P%20=%20k%20\cdot%20N(-d_2)%20-%20f%20\cdot%20N(-d_1))  

Where:  
- \( N(\cdot) \) = standard normal cumulative distribution.  
- \( f \) = forward price of the future.  
- \( k \) = strike price.  
- \( \sigma \) = volatility.  
- \( t \) = time to expiry (years).  

---

### Intuition in Words  
- \( f \cdot N(d_1) \): **Expected value of being long futures**, adjusted for probability of ending up above strike.  
- \( k \cdot N(d_2) \): **Strike ‚Äúcost‚Äù**, weighted by probability of exercise.  
- The difference is the **fair value** of the option.  

For puts, the roles flip: you‚Äôre insuring against downside, so the payoff comes from the probability of finishing **below strike**.  

---

### Why We Use It in the Fund  
- **Macro overlay portfolios** trade heavily in futures (commodities, indices, FX).  
- Black 76 ensures we price these options consistently with how futures already embed carry.  
- It‚Äôs the **industry standard** in commodities and rates ‚Äî so our numbers are directly comparable to brokers, exchanges, and other funds.

## üßÆ Example: Black 76 Option Pricer

```python
from math import log, sqrt
from scipy.stats import norm

def black76_price(f, k, t, sigma, is_call=True):
    """ Price a European option on futures using Black 76 """
    if t <= 0 or sigma <= 0:
        return max(0.0, (f - k) if is_call else (k - f))
    
    d1 = (log(f / k) + 0.5 * sigma**2 * t) / (sigma * sqrt(t))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(t)
    
    if is_call:
        return f * norm.cdf(d1) - k * norm.cdf(d2)
    else:
        return k * norm.cdf(-d2) - f * norm.cdf(-d1)
